# RE exercises week 2

This is a small collection of exercises collected over the past year or so of ctfs.
Most of them take some input and then compare it to a flag.

This style covers

* `arr`
* `next`
* `d`
* `rng`
* `seq`
* `u`

Some files contain hidden information, including

* `begin`
* `LockyMcLockface`
* `d.img.xz` (which is not a binary but a disk image)

The last few files all have buffer overflows which cause misbehaviour.

* `buffer1`
* `buffer2`
* `container`
* `safetycheck`

`morse` has three objectives:
* Find the hidden option
* Find the leaked information in `cake.wav`
* Generate another valid license
